# Typie - Electron Framework
> A Small minimal framework structure to get started developing with electron

## Getting Started
Just clone it to your dev machine and run `yarn` to install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-webpack-quick-start.git
cd electron-webpack-quick-start
rm -rf .git

# install dependencies
yarn
```

 [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager is `npm` on steroids -> use it, don't by lazy.

### Scripts

> run application in development mode
```bash
yarn dev
```

> compile source code and create webpack output
```bash
yarn compile
```

> `yarn compile` & create build with electron-builder
```bash
yarn dist
```

> `yarn compile` & create unpacked build with electron-builder
```bash
yarn dist:dir
```
